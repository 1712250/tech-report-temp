## How to use the Tech Report template
**Developer/Technical people version**

For the people that know how to use Git with the commandline. Follow these instructions:

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) on your computer.
2. Go to the folder (in the commandline/terminal) where you want to store all your Technical reports.
3. Add the git clone command with the url in your commandline/terminal
<code>git clone https://github.com/raymonschouwenaar/tech-report-temp.git</code>
4. Now you have a clone of my GitHub repo on your computer.  
5. I want to advice you to copy the folder and rename the date, your projectname and your First and lastname. So if there is an update for the template you can go to the folder (in the commandline/terminal) and type <code>git pull</code> so the template will be updated.
6. To check if there is an update type <code>git status</code> in the template folder.

**Non or less technical people version**

For the people that dont't know how to use Git with the commandline. Follow these instructions:

1. If you have an GitHub account and you have installed the Software of GitHub. You only have to click on the button "**Clone in Desktop**" on the right column at the bottom.
2. If you didn't have a GitHub account or for some reason you want to download an ZIP file with all the files in it. Just click on "**Download ZIP**" on the right column at the bottom.
